# Macroeconomic-Driven Yield Curve Forecasting and FX Hedging Strategy

This project builds a framework to forecast government bond yield curves using macroeconomic indicators
and simulate currency hedging strategies based on predicted interest rate shifts.

## 📌 Objectives
- Predict short/long-term yields using machine learning.
- Analyze the impact of rate moves on major currency pairs.
- Backtest FX hedging strategies using forwards/options.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter
- Libraries: pandas, sklearn, XGBoost, matplotlib, statsmodels
- Data Sources: FRED, Alpha Vantage, ECB, IMF

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Analysis and modeling steps
- `src/`: Modular Python code
- `data/`: Economic indicators and yield data
- `reports/`: Charts and evaluation metrics

## 📊 Features
- Yield curve fitting (Nelson-Siegel)
- Macroeconomic feature engineering
- FX impact modeling and correlation analysis
- Hedging strategy simulation

## 📈 Output
- Forecasted yield curves and currency reactions
- Hedging performance (Sharpe ratio, VaR, etc.)

## 🚀 Future Work
- Real-time data ingestion
- Deploy dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
